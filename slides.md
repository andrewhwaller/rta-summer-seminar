# What is the _canon_?

---
layout: statement

# The _canon_ is the collection of texts that the church receives as the communication of God to his people and the church's rule for faith and practice.

# How do we get from _scripture_ to _canon_?

# 3 Corinthians: canonical or not?

<!--
* So, hypothetically, what if we're able to demonstrate that 3 Corinthians was actually written by Paul?
* Does that text then gain canonical status?

# 1–2 Timothy weren't written by Paul: canonical or not?

<!--
* Again, what if the scholars who say that Paul didn't write 1–2 Timothy are right?
* What if we're able to conclusively demonstrate that these aren't authentic Pauline writings?
* Do these texts then lose canonical status?

## Extrinsic model (cynical version)
#### The boundaries of the canon are determined by those in power, whether ecclesial or political.

<!--
* Canonicity is largely a function of power and hierarchy rather than a product of the text.
* This approach generally focuses on a description of the human political processes that produce the result that is the canon.
* Intellectual history/political history, rather than a theological treatment.

## Extrinsic model (ecclesial version)
#### The boundaries of the canon are determined through the deliberation of the apostolic church.

<!--
* The church is able to authoritatively determine the shape of the canon.
* This approach will generally emphasize ecclesiology and the church's authority, particularly along apostolic lines.
* Sometimes this model will be caricatured as a "Catholic" position, where the tradition of the church dominates the authority of the canon itself.
    * However, many Catholics would readily acknowledge that church councils recognize but do not create the canon.

## Intrinsic models
#### Can we determine canonicity via the texts themselves?
* Criteria of canonicity? Apostolic origin, ecclesial use, historical authenticity?
* Self-authentication? Providence, attributes of canonicity, testimony of the Spirit?

<!--
* Historical reliability/accuracy is not the same thing as divine authority!
    * If it could be demonstrated that the Islamic account of the origins of the Quran was completely historically accurate, would that then require me to grant the Quran divine authority? We'd probably say no.
* A self-authentication model is a step in the right direction.
    * However, this model still requires a significant emphasis on history.
    * This isn't bad, but the move to treat texts as historical or apostolic artefacts is often made too quickly.
    * In my mind, this model is still trying to provide theological and historical answers the questions that historical critics are asking, rather than beginning with the work of God in Christ.
    * This approach can end up being a theologized extrinsic model, with the Holy Spirit being the asterisk that legitimizes the historical processes that produce the canon.

# 2 Sam 7:5–16
“Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord: … When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom….
And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me.
Your throne shall be established forever.’”

# Psalm 89:29–35
“I will establish [David’s] offspring forever and his throne as the days of the heavens.
If his children forsake my law… then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes, but I will not remove from him my steadfast love or be false to my faithfulness.
I will not violate my covenant or alter the word that went forth from my lips.
Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David.”

Jer 31:31–34: “The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah.
It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt... This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time,” declares the Lord.
“***I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts.***
I will be their God, and they will be my people.
***No longer will they teach their neighbor***, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,” declares the Lord.
“For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”

Jer 33:14–16: “‘The days are coming,’ declares the Lord, ‘when I will fulfill the good promise I made to the people of Israel and Judah. In those days and at that time I will make a righteous Branch sprout from David’s line; he will do what is just and right in the land. In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. This is the name by which it will be called: The Lord Our Righteous Savior.’”
